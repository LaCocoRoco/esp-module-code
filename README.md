## Information regards this codebase

Due to the lengthy development process and numerous necessary workarounds, the final codebase feels like a patchwork. Ideally, it should be rewritten from scratch. However, this would require extensive time for redevelopment and retesting. Since there is no significant benefit to doing so, the code will continue to be used in its current form.
